# Parking lot — noticed during the typography sweep, not swept

Non-typography drift observed while sweeping (2026-09-02). Each is a
future sweep or decision of its own; nothing here blocks anything.

- **The spacing/radius zoo.** Raw paddings, gaps, margins and radii
  everywhere the typography sweep walked (`.theme-cell` 1rem/0.75rem,
  fixture inline styles, page cards 1.25rem/0.5rem/999px pills, …).
  Same disease, different organ — needs its own census, map and ramp
  decisions (the `--size-*` scale exists).
- **CtaLinkButton's ghost tokens** — `--fontSize-cta` and
  `--fontFamily-button` don't exist in the semantic layer; the
  defensive fallbacks are the real values (ADR-0008 violation).
  Needs a voice decision: is CTA the label voice at a bigger stop, or
  its own voice?
- **The Eyebrow primitive** — the tracked-caps manner (letter-spacing +
  uppercase on map badges, pillar eyebrows, guide labels, table headers)
  is deliberately allowlisted raw until the Eyebrow component exists
  (notes-typography-components.md). When it lands, those allowlist rows
  should shrink to zero.
- **The pill component** — res-name/value chips, doc chips, badges share
  a shape (border, radius, small text, name/value pair). Nicklas: own
  component, defined after the sweep passes.
- **text-align as a swept property** — open question from the plan:
  Heading owns alignment via data-align; page-local text-align is
  arguably the same drift. Decide when the spacing sweep is scoped.
